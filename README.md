# Time-series-data-analysis
In this project I have worked with different datasets and used the models FB-Prophet, ARIMA Model, VAR Model, and SARIMAX Model.

### In this project I have performed the time series analysis with the below models using different datasets. 

## 1. FB- Prophet model
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

Why is the Prophet model better?

It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Seasonal effects caused by human behavior: weekly, monthly and yearly cycles, dips and peaks on public holidays.

## 2. ARIMA Model
An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends. A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values.

The main advantage of ARIMA forecasting is that it requires data on the time series in question only. First, this feature is advantageous if one is forecasting a large number of time series. Second, this avoids a problem that occurs sometimes with multivariate models.

## 3. VAR Model

Vector autoregression (VAR) is a statistical model used to capture the relationship between multiple quantities as they change over time. VAR is a type of stochastic process model. VAR models generalize the single-variable (univariate) autoregressive model by allowing for multivariate time series.

### Advantages
✔ A systematic but flexible approach for capturing complex real-world behavior.

✔	Better forecasting performance.

✔	Ability to capture the intertwined dynamics of time series data.

## 4. SARIMAX Model

SARIMAX(Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) is an updated version of the ARIMA model. we can say SARIMAX is a seasonal equivalent model like SARIMA and Auto ARIMA. it can also deal with external effects. This feature of the model differs from other models.
